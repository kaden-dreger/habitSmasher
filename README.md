# Habit Smasher
This is an Android app that allows for users to keep track of habits, follow their friends and see what they're up to, and even geotag habit events!

### Running instructions

#### Adding habit events
To make progress on your existing habits, you can add specific instances (with locations and pictures) when you performed that habit (these are called events).
